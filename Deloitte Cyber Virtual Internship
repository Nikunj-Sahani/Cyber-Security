Here is your task
In this task you will be joining our cyber security team. Your job is to:

Determine if the alleged breach could have happened from an attacker on the internet directly (i.e. no access to Daikibo's VPN).
Inspect a web_requests.log file (listing only data from a period when the alleged attack has to have happened):
Try to spot suspicious requests
Hint: In the Resources section, you can find a diagram example of how to read the logs file
Hint: Look for longer sequences of user requests
Hint: Notice the order of requests from Login → to requests for the dashboard page's resources (styles, scripts, images, etc.) → to API requests for the actual statuses of the machines
Hint: How would you recognise if an automated request to the API happens at an exact interval of time (assume no such functionality is available in the dashboard)?
If you've identified such requests make sure to write down the ID of the user (it's part of the requests)
Here is how the web_requests.log file is structured:

There is a sequence of blocks of text divided by empty lines
Each block represents the activity of a unique IP address (no 2 blocks have the same IP)
The block starts with the IP address followed by a table of the requests made to Daikibo's telemetry dashboard (the dashboard lives in Daikibo's intranet) by the device with this IP address, sorted by time
The IP addresses are from the internal Daikibo network and are static
1 block can represent 1 or multiple browsing sessions
Sessions made on different dates require new logins
There is no continuous polling/pushing of data between client and server - the users need to refresh the page to get the latest data
Hint: For an easier visual inspection, open up the file in a code editor like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code, expand the window to the full width of your screen and decrease font size until no text breaks on a new line
When you believe you have completed the 2 tasks above, submit your work by taking a quick quiz to check your discoveries. Start the quiz by clicking 'Start your quiz' below. Good luck!

🧠 Blue Team Mindset: Detection Over Exploitation
Unlike red teaming, where you’re the attacker, blue teaming is all about defense — detecting threats, mitigating them, and preserving the integrity of systems. In this case, I stepped into the shoes of a SOC analyst: scouring logs, recognizing behavioral patterns, and isolating the threat vector before the damage escalates.

Think of it as a tactical blend of:

🕵️‍♂️ Log analysis
🔐 Authentication flow review
🧮 Anomaly detection
🚫 Access control verification
The key? Pattern recognition — and I was on it.

🚨 Suspicious User Detected:
User ID: dBCm2JjBU815PB8zPDvKqv

💡 Here’s What Gave It Away:
✅ Logged in like everyone else. Nothing unusual at first.

🤔 Then, a sequence of automated API requests began — hitting all factory endpoints.
⏱️ The pattern? Punctual. Every hour. On the dot. No frontend elements were requested — no styles, no scripts, no human browsing indicators.
🤖 This was no human. This was scripted access — silent, persistent, and efficient.

❓Q1: Can an attacker reach the dashboard directly from the internet?
🟢 Answer: No. The dashboard lives behind a VPN-only internal intranet. No direct access from external IPs — unless someone on the inside lets you in.

❓Q2: Who triggered the breach behavior?
🟢 Answer: dBCm2JjBU815PB8zPDvKqv The only user displaying machine-like querying frequency, accessing factory endpoints without UI resource calls.
